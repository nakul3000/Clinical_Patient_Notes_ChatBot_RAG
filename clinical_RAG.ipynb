Medications on Admission included Amiodarone 100 QD, Colace 100 bid, lasix 40mg QD, Glyburide 5mg bid, Plaquenil 200mg bid, Isordil 20mg tid, Lisinopril 20mg QD, Coumadin 5mg 3dys/week, 2.5mg 4dys/week, Norvasc 10mg QD, Neurontin 300mg TID, with APAP prn. An override was added on 10/2/06 by Gerad E. Dancy, PA for POTENTIALLY SERIOUS INTERACTION: AMIODARONE HCL & WARFARIN with the reason for override being monitoring. The patient was rehydrated with IVF and PO's were encouraged, holding Glypizide while in house, Novolog sliding scale was started on 1/2, Low dose NPH 6 units BID was started on 1/2, bridged with lovenox and INR therapeutic 1/2 and restarted on home regimen of 5/2.5mg variable dose. Pain was controlled with TYLENOL (ACETAMINOPHEN) 650 MG PO Q4H PRN Pain, Headache. A CT pelvis showed a right adnexal cyst which will need further characterization by US and outpatient follow up. The patient has an extensive cardiac history and the fall is not likely related to a cardiac issue as it appears mechanical, with no syncope, chest pain, etc. She was diagnosed with an NSTEMI with a small TnI leak, likely demand related in the setting of hypovolemia and the fall. Enzymes trended down. She was dry on admission and rehydrated with IVF, PO's encouraged, and became euvolemic by 1/2. Her JVP was up to 12cm, although it was difficult to gauge her volume status due to TR. She had a prolonged QT on admission, on telemetry, of unclear etiology, possibly starvation. This was monitored on telemetry until ROMI and drugs that confound were avoided. The QTc resolved to low 500s and a DDD pacer was functioning with V-pacing at 60bpm.

       "\"The patient was admitted on 5/5/2006 with a history of mechanical fall, with the attending physician being Dr. Clemente Armand Bolstad, with a full code status and disposition of Rehabilitation. Medications on Admission included Amiodarone 100 QD, Colace 100 bid, lasix 40mg QD, Glyburide 5mg bid, Plaquenil 200mg bid, Isordil 20mg tid, Lisinopril 20mg QD, Coumadin 5mg 3dys/week, 2.5mg 4dys/week, Norvasc 10mg QD, Neurontin 300mg TID, with APAP prn. An override was added on 10/2/06 by Gerad E. Dancy, PA for POTENTIALLY SERIOUS INTERACTION: AMIODARONE HCL & WARFARIN with the reason for override being monitoring. The patient was rehydrated with IVF and PO's were encouraged, holding Glypizide while in house, Novolog sliding scale was started on 1/2, Low dose NPH 6 units BID was started on 1/2, bridged with lovenox and INR therapeutic 1/2 and restarted on home regimen of 5/2.5mg variable dose. Pain was controlled with TYLENOL (ACETAMINOPHEN) 650 MG PO Q4H PRN Pain, Headache. A CT pelvis showed a right adnexal cyst which will need further characterization by US and outpatient follow up. The patient has an extensive cardiac history and the fall is not likely related to a cardiac issue as it appears mechanical, with no syncope, chest pain, etc. She was diagnosed with an NSTEMI with a small TnI leak, likely demand related in the setting of hypovolemia and the fall. Enzymes trended down. She was dry on admission and rehydrated with IVF, PO's encouraged, and became euvolemic by 1/2. Her JVP was up to 12cm, although it was difficult to gauge her volume status due to TR. She had a prolonged QT on admission, on telemetry, of unclear etiology, possibly starvation. This was monitored on telemetry until ROMI and drugs that confound were avoided. The QTc resolved to low 500s and a DDD pacer was functioning with V-pacing at 60bpm. Additional medications included NATURAL TEARS (ARTIFICIAL TEARS) 2 DROP OU BID, COLACE (DOCUSATE SODIUM) 100 MG PO BID, PLAQUENIL SULFATE (HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE) 200 MG PO BID, ISORDIL (ISOSORBIDE DINITRATE) 20 MG PO TID, LISINOPRIL 20 MG PO DAILY HOLD IF: SBP <110, MILK OF MAGNESIA (MAGNESIUM HYDROXIDE) 30 MILLILITERS PO DAILY PRN Constipation, COUMADIN (WARFARIN SODIUM) 2.5 MG PO QPM, NORVASC (AMLODIPINE) 10 MG PO DAILY HOLD IF: SBP <110, NEURONTIN (GABAPENTIN) 300 MG PO TID, NEXIUM (ESOMEPRAZOLE) 20 MG PO DAILY, MAALOX-TABLETS QUICK DISSOLVE/CHEWABLE 1-2 TAB PO Q6H PRN Upset Stomach, DULCOLAX RECTAL (BISACODYL RECTAL) 10 MG PR DAILY PRN Constipation, CLOTRIMAZOLE 1% TOPICAL TOPICAL TP BID, GLYBURIDE 5 MG PO BID, LASIX (FUROSEMIDE) 20 MG PO DAILY, and corrected pt restarted on lasix 20 qd on d/c.
