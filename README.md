# Clinical_RAG_Patient_Notes_Summary
LLM based RAG app where Clinicians can chat with longitudinal unstructured patient data and summrize medical history.

# Clinical_RAG_Patient_Notes_Summary

**Clinical_RAG_Patient_Notes_Summary** is an innovative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application powered by large language models (LLMs). This tool is designed to help clinicians interact with longitudinal unstructured patient data, enabling them to chat with the system and receive concise summaries of a patient's medical history.

## Features

- **LLM-Powered Interaction:** Leverages advanced large language models to understand and process unstructured clinical notes.
- **RAG Framework:** Combines retrieval techniques with generative models to fetch relevant information from vast amounts of patient data, enhancing the accuracy of responses.
- **Chat Interface:** Provides a conversational interface where clinicians can ask questions and engage in dialogue about a patient's medical history.
- **Summarization:** Automatically summarizes complex, longitudinal patient data into coherent medical history overviews.
- **Enhanced Insight:** Helps clinicians quickly access key aspects of a patient's past medical records, improving decision-making and patient care.

## How It Works

1. **Data Input:** Unstructured clinical notes and patient data are fed into the system.
2. **Retrieval:** The RAG architecture retrieves the most relevant pieces of information from the patient's historical data.
3. **Generation:** An LLM processes the retrieved data, generating a coherent, summarized response tailored to the clinician's query.
4. **Interaction:** Clinicians interact with the app through a chat interface, asking for clarifications, additional details, or new summaries based on evolving needs.

## Getting Started

To get started with **Clinical_RAG_Patient_Notes_Summary**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Clinical_RAG_Patient_Notes_Summary.git
   cd Clinical_RAG_Patient_Notes_Summary
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Follow the instructions in the `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` to set up the necessary environment and dependencies.

3. **Configure Data Access:**
   Ensure that the unstructured patient data is accessible by the application. Update configuration files or environment variables as needed to connect to your data sources.

4. **Run the Application:**
   Execute the main script to launch the chat interface.
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Usage:**
   - Start chatting with the system by entering questions about a patient's history.
   - The application will retrieve relevant data, process it through the LLM, and provide a summarized response.
